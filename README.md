# Investigate-Hotel-Business-Using-Data-Visualization

# Description
I am here as a member of the Data Scientist team in a hotel company. I am responsible for providing insights into the hotel's business performance. These insights can be sought by conducting data exploration, such as analyzing how customers behave in booking hotel tickets or looking for factors that affect the cancellation of hotel ticket bookings. Then present it in the form of visualization and data storytelling.
